# <center> Beyond the Curve: Advanced Techniques help LLMs to Solve Conic Problem <center>


The use of large language models (LLMs) to solve mathematical problems is nowadays a heated topic. However, benchmarks like GSM8k often involve problems solvable
with shallow heuristics and limited knowledge scope, restricting the assessment of modelsâ€™ understanding of complex mathematical logic. Various methods have been employed to enhance mathematical performance, each with complementary strengths. To address these limitations, we investigated the performance of multiple language models on the more challenging CONIC10K dataset and improved model accuracy through code and program prompts and fine-tuning. Additionally, we developed an Automated Verification System using Regular Expressions and SymPy to ensure accurate
performance measurement. We think our work is inspiring, the topic of combining code with large language models still has strong development potential.

The relating code has been provided.
